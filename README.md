# processing-dark-theme
This is my dark theme for Processing. I'm not the first to do this, and I used many other tools, so here's some credit.  
https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_3.0 is the original dark theme which this is based off of. 
https://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=perfect_dos_vga_437 is the font used for the text editor now. 
https://www.dafont.com/pacifico.font is the font used for everything else. 
I hope you enjoy this! 

<h1>Install</h1>
   <p>Put the fonts in the folder (processing)\lib. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Put the preferences.txt in C:\Users\(you)\AppData\Roaming\Processing</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Put the theme.txt in the lib folder in processing (or drop the lib folder in and hit replace).</p>
<p></p>
  <p> Please tell me if this doesn't work! </p>
